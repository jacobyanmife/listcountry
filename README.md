The code was written in fluttter for a better ui and it works with a few 
packages and widgets to make the devlopment much attractive.
The code was structured in duc a way that user can easily make use of the app 
Without restrictions and it was written using simple features for a beginner flutter developer
To understand.


# description of the libraries
I made use of flutter package called http to call the API URL used in the app and I
Also used value notifier for dark mode changes.


# challenges faced
- System challenge and i had to get a technical person to help out

Along with assistance from friends and colleagues.
- the faster I resolve the better I get used to the system.

Is really giving me tough time with all my attempts and also will love to understand better how to resolve
